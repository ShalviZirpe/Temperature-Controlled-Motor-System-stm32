STM32 Temperature Controller: A temperature regulation system built using the STM32 microcontroller. This project monitors room temperature using an LM35 sensor and adjusts a fan motor's speed to maintain the desired temperature. Features include real-time temperature display on an LCD and adjustable temperature thresholds via code.

Features:
Real-time temperature sensing using the LM35 sensor.
Temperature display on an LCD screen.
Automatic fan speed adjustment based on temperature.
Compact design powered via USB.

Technologies Used:
STM32 microcontroller (STM32G030K6T6)
ADC configuration for temperature sensing.
PWM or relay control for fan speed regulation.
LCD interface for user feedback.
